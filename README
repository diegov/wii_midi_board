midi_board: a little program that reads info from the wii balance board
and outputs midi control messages through jack

DEPENDENCIES

* Cwiid <http://abstrakraft.org/cwiid/>
* Jack <http://jackaudio.org/>

On Debian systems:
apt-get install libcwiid-dev libjack-dev

OTHER REQUIREMENTS

* A wii balance board
* Bluetooth

USAGE

* Run midi_board
* Press the sync button (next to the batteries) in the wii balance board 
  and press enter
* Once the balance board is synchronised, place the board down and press 
  enter to read the calibration data
* At this point the program will start sending data for CCs 7 and 11
  on channel 1

midi_board sends the data throguh jack midi. If you're using an application that 
only accepts alsa midi input, you can use a2j <http://home.gna.org/a2jmidid/> 
to bridge between jack midi and alsa midi.

CONFIGURATION

None at the moment

TODO

* Configurable CC numbers
* Configurable control rate
* Sample-accurate scheduling of CC messages, we're relying on the 
  frames/period being small enough but we should do it properly
* Cleanup Wii IO thread, handle signals
* Adjustable input range, -1/1 values aren't really possible on the
  wii balance board, there's always some weight on the opposite side
* Jack session support
